The Odin Project - Project: Library

This is an assignment for [The Odin Project Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). 

The assignment was to create a library of books stored in an array and display the book information 
on a webpage. The user is able to add a book by clicking a button and be able to delete books
from the library. There is also a way to toggle the read status of the book via clicking a button.

I have added the ability to edit the existing books in the library.

Currently, there is no storage of books, as the assignment said to come back to that later
after future lessons in the course.
